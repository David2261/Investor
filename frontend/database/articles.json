		"description": "The Swiss National Bank (SNB) conducts the country's monetary policy as an independent central bank. It is obliged by Constitution and statute to act in accordance with the interests of the country as a whole. Its primary goal is to ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. In so doing, it creates an appropriate environment for economic growth. Price stability is an important prerequisite for growth and prosperity. Inflation and deflation, by contrast, impair economic activity. They hinder the role of prices in allocating labour and capital to their most efficient use, and result in a redistribution of income and wealth. The SNB equates price stability with a rise in consumer prices of less than 2% per annum. Deflation - i.e. a sustained decrease in the price level - also breaches the objective of price stability. A medium-term inflation forecast serves as the main indicator for monetary policy decisions. The Swiss National Bank implements its monetary policy by setting the SNB policy rate. In so doing, it seeks to keep the short-term Swiss franc money market rates close to the SNB policy rate. In order to influence monetary conditions, the SNB also intervenes in the foreign exchange market, as necessary.",
